## CONTENT DESCRIPTION:

- "autocorr_check.cpp": implements the blocking technique and ranges over different block sizes dim_block, returning the plot of variance vs dim_block for all files specified in file_list.txt.

- "polyff.cpp": this script takes the fermionic and bosonic measurement files for each temperature and returns a file with the temperature along with the mean and standard deviation for these observables. When selected, blocking is applied with block sizes selectable from an external file.

- "simple_computation".cpp: simple script to compute mass of quark in MeV.

- "visual_monte_carlo_history.cpp": visualization of Monte Carlo history.

- "visual_polyffT.cpp": visualization of the mean values ​​of the observables (with corresponding standard deviation) as a function of the temperature.
